**Brian Sostek Visual Argument 2020 Fall**

The main idea of my visual argument is to show that trade school is just as viable an option as college.

Asset List:

* Graduation Cap Clipart
* Trade insignias, such as a hammer or plunger.
* Estimated figures of salary, perhaps from wikipedia or large reputable data source.
* Receipt paper to show difference of debt out of first year of work.
