**Brian Sostek Visual Argument 2020 Fall**

The main idea of my visual argument is to show that trade school is just as viable an option as college.

PROPOSED Asset List:

* Graduation Cap Clipart
* Trade insignias, such as a hammer or plunger.
* Estimated figures of salary, perhaps from wikipedia or large reputable data source.
* Receipt paper to show difference of debt out of first year of work.

CURRENT Asset List:

* Receipt paper https://receiptify.herokuapp.com/
* Welding Mask- Noun Project (Created by Laymik)
* Graduation Cap- Noun Project (Created by Symbolon)
